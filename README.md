# Minesweeper Game
Minesweeper is a classic Microsoft Windows game which was first introduced in the standard install of Windows 3.1 in 1992. 

The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares on a gridboard that do not contain mines. There is a logical process to discover the location of the mines, but some will require guessing, with a 50-50 chance of being correct.

1. Select the board size (8x8, 16x16, 24x24)
2. The total number of mines is display on counter.
3. Click on any cell on the board to start the game (and the timer)
4. If you uncovered a number (from 1 to 8), it depicts the number of mines adjacent to it (which is covered).
5. If you uncovered an empty cell, a number of adjacent empty cells may be uncovered too.
6. If you uncovered a mine, game over.
7. To avoid hitting a mine, the location of a "suspected" mine can be marked with a flag. This can be done by using **"Shift + Click"** to add flags onto a cell.
8. To win the game, all numbered and empty cells have to be uncovered.
